# HexCoach!
This is a simple game/tool for assessing and improving your ability to guess hex codes for colors. In theory messages (or other arbitrary data) could be encoded into colors, but the average person can't read colors perfectly. Thus, this tool allows users to encode arbitrary messages into colors as concisely as possible while still being decodeable by them personally.
